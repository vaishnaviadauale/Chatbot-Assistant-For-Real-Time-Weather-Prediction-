# Chatbot-Assistant-For-Real-Time-Weather-Prediction-

## Problem Statement: 
Obtaining accurate, real-time weather information is challenging due to fragmented sources and the need for manual searching. Current platforms often lack interactivity and personalization, making it difficult for users to quickly access relevant weather updates and critical alerts. There is a need for an integrated, user-friendly solution that provides seamless, personalized weather information in real-time.

## Objectives:
The goal is to develop a Chatbot-Assistant-For-Real-Time-Weather-Prediction that:

Provides seamless, real-time weather updates.
Aggregates weather data from multiple reliable sources into one platform.
Offers an interactive and user-friendly interface for querying weather information.
Delivers personalized weather forecasts and alerts based on user preferences.
Ensures timely updates and notifications for critical weather changes.

## What is Ridge Regression ?
"Ridge Regression is a linear regression technique that mitigates overfitting and addresses multicollinearity by introducing a penalty to the sum of squared coefficients. This regularization term aids in shrinking the coefficients, resulting in more robust and generalized models. The penalty term is governed by a parameter, denoted as Î» (lambda), which balances the model's fit and the magnitude of the coefficients."

Conclusion
The Chatbot-Assistant-For-Real-Time-Weather-Prediction project aims to revolutionize how users access and interact with weather information. By providing real-time, aggregated, and personalized weather updates through an interactive chatbot interface, this solution addresses the limitations of current weather services and enhances the overall user experience.

Future additions to enhance Weather Prediction Chat application:
1.Get Live Data Through API and Autosave to Database Without Human Interruption:
- Implement a mechanism to periodically fetch live weather data through an API without requiring user interaction.
- Set up automatic saving of this data to a database to ensure it's always up-to-date and readily available for predictions.

2.Deploy in AWS (Amazon Web Services):
- Utilize AWS services such as EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) for hosting your application, RDS (Relational Database Service) for database management, and perhaps S3 (Simple Storage Service) for storing static assets like images.
- Deploying your application on AWS ensures scalability, reliability, and ease of management.

3.Use Another Machine Learning Model to Improve Accuracy:
- Explore different machine learning models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or even deep learning models like Neural Networks to improve the accuracy of weather predictions.
- Evaluate the performance of these models and choose the one that provides the best results for your application.
